# ‚úçÔ∏è Academic English: Style and Tense Reminders

Clear and correct English is crucial for effective academic communication. These tips, although not exhaustive, will hopefully help you avoid common pitfalls and improve the quality of your writing. They are based on my observations of common mistakes in student writing, as well as my experiences writing, failing, and reviewing papers.


>Strive for clarity, precision, and consistency in your academic writing. Small details in language can significantly impact how your work is perceived.

## üßê Academic Writing Style: Patterns and Anti-Patterns

Here are some best practices to follow (Patterns) and common pitfalls to avoid (Anti-Patterns).

### ‚úÖ Patterns: Best Practices

- **Use Formal Language**
  - Employ precise vocabulary and avoid slang, colloquialisms, or overly casual phrases.
  - *Example*: Use "approximately" or "roughly" instead of "about"; "numerous" or "a significant number of" instead of "a lot of."

- **Maintain Consistent English Variant**
  - Choose either British or American English and use it consistently for spelling, punctuation, and grammar throughout your document. Many prefer American English (anecdotal evidence).
  - *Example*: If you start with "organise" and "colour" (British), avoid switching to "organize" and "color" (American).

- **Write in Full Sentences**
  - Ensure each sentence is grammatically complete with a subject and a verb, expressing a clear thought.
  - Avoid sentence fragments, especially in formal prose. While bullet points are useful for lists, ensure narrative text flows in complete sentences.

- **Introduce Acronyms Properly**
  - Spell out the full term followed by the acronym in parentheses upon its first mention. Introduce the acronym only if it will be used multiple times in the text, and do so only at its first appearance.
  - *Example*: "The study employed Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze data."
  
- **Use Active Voice Predominantly**
  - Active voice constructions are generally clearer, more direct, and more engaging.
  - *Example*: "The researchers conducted the experiment" is often better than "The experiment was conducted by the researchers."
  - Passive voice can be used strategically, for instance, when the action or recipient is more important than the actor, or to vary sentence structure.

- **Employ Hedging Where Appropriate**
  - Use cautious language (modal verbs like *may, might, could*, or qualifiers like *suggests, indicates, appears*) to express probability or to qualify claims, especially when discussing results or interpretations.
  - *Example*: "The results suggest that this approach may be effective under certain conditions."

- **Use Proper Punctuation**
  - Mastering the use of commas, semicolons, colons, and periods takes a lot of practice. Semicolons can be hard to master; consider using commas or periods instead if unsure.
  
- **Proofread and Edit Meticulously**
  - Always review your work for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, punctuation errors, clarity, and coherence. 
  - Consider reading aloud, using proofreading tools (with caution), and seeking peer review.
  - Grammarly and AI tools can help, but they are not infallible. Always double-check their suggestions.

### ‚ùå Anti-Patterns: Practices to Avoid

- **Avoid Contractions**
  - Do not use shortened forms like "don't", "can't", "it's", "we've", "they'll".
  - Use the full forms: "do not", "cannot", "it is" (or "it has"), "we have", "they will".

- **Avoid Informal Language and Slang**
  - Refrain from using slang, idioms, clich√©s, or overly conversational phrases.
  - *Example*: Replace "it‚Äôs a bit tricky" with "it is somewhat complex" or "it presents challenges."

- **Avoid Overuse of Passive Voice**
  - While passive voice has its place, excessive use can make writing vague, indirect, or overly formal.
  - Strive for a balance, favoring active voice for clarity and directness.

- **Avoid Unnecessary Abbreviations and Jargon**
  - Only use abbreviations that are standard in your field or that you have clearly defined.
  - Explain technical jargon if your audience may not be familiar with it.

- **Avoid Long, Overly Complex Sentences**
  - Break down lengthy sentences into shorter, clearer ones. Each sentence should ideally convey a single main idea or a few closely related points.


## üï∞Ô∏è Verb Tense Consistency in Academic Writing

Maintaining consistent and appropriate verb tenses is crucial, as inconsistencies can confuse readers and obscure the timeline of your research.

### üìä Tense Usage by Section (General Guidelines)

| Section             | Preferred Tense(s)                      | Purpose                                                                                                |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Abstract**        | Present Simple, Past Simple, Present Perfect | - Present Simple for general statements/conclusions.<br>- Past Simple for specific methods/results.<br>- Present Perfect for summarizing previous research. |
| **Introduction**    | Present Simple, Present Perfect, Past Simple | - Present Simple for established knowledge.<br>- Present Perfect for previous research with ongoing relevance.<br>- Past Simple for specific past studies. |
| **Literature Review** | Present Simple, Past Simple, Present Perfect | - Present Simple for discussing theories/general findings.<br>- Past Simple for specific past studies.<br>- Present Perfect for ongoing relevance of past research. |
| **Methods**         | Past Simple                             | - Describe procedures and actions completed *during your study*.                                       |
| **Results**         | Past Simple (for findings), Present Simple (for figures/tables) | - Past Simple to report *your findings*.<br>- Present Simple when referring to figures/tables ("Table 1 shows..."). |
| **Discussion**      | Present Simple, Past Simple, Present Perfect | - Present Simple for interpreting results/implications.<br>- Past Simple for referring to *your specific findings*.<br>- Present Perfect to connect past findings to current discussion. |
| **Conclusion**      | Present Simple, Past Simple, Present Perfect | - Present Simple for summarizing *your* conclusions.<br>- Past Simple for restating what *you did or found*.<br>- Present Perfect to emphasize relevance. |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Tense-Related Pitfalls

- **Inconsistent Tense Usage**: Switching tenses within the same section or paragraph without a clear reason (e.g., describing a single past study's methods in present tense).
- **Incorrect Tense for Section**: Using present tense in the Methods section to describe your completed actions, or past tense for universally accepted truths in the Introduction.

### üëç Best Practices for Tense Consistency

- **Plan Tense Usage**: Before writing, consider which tenses are most appropriate for each section based on standard academic conventions.
- **Maintain Tense Within Sections**: Strive to use a primary tense within each section unless a shift is necessary for clarity (e.g., discussing established knowledge in present tense before describing a past study).
- **Review and Edit for Tense**: After drafting, specifically review your paper for tense consistency and appropriateness.
- **Use Time Markers**: Words like "previously," "currently," "in this study," or specific dates can help clarify the timing of events and justify tense choices.
