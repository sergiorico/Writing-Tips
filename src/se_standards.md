# 📊 Methodology Highlight: Empirical Standards for Software Engineering

To support rigorous and transparent research in Software Engineering, the [ACM SIGSOFT Empirical Standards](https://www2.sigsoft.org/EmpiricalStandards/docs/standards) establish **community expectations** for how studies should be conducted and reported.

>Use these standards and the essental attributes as a **checklist** for your thesis or research project. There are **standards** for various study types, including qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods.

### 🛠 Example: Repository Mining Standard

If your thesis involves **mining software repositories**, you’ll find a dedicated checklist in the standard. It lists **essential** and **desirable** attributes for transparency and rigor:

#### ✅ Essential Attributes

- Justifies why repository mining fits the research question  
- Defines units of analysis and data sources (e.g., GitHub, StackOverflow)  
- Explains selection criteria and how repositories were chosen and validated  
- Describes preprocessing, sampling, and dataset characteristics  
- If annotation is used: reports annotator background, procedures, inter-rater reliability  
- Justifies metrics and addresses threats to external validity  

#### ⭐ Desirable Attributes

- Shares dataset and tools used  
- Uses probability sampling  
- Triangulates data or analysts  
- Reflects on annotator bias  
- Discusses ethics in mining repositories  
- Validates tools (e.g., through testing) and builds or tests theory  

These can be used as a **checklist** when planning or reviewing your work.
