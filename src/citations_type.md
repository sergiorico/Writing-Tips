# 🎯 Citing with Purpose: A Guide to Using References

In academic writing, citing prior work is essential to situate your research and demonstrate scholarly integrity. Every citation should have a clear motive.

> Avoid mechanically adding references at the end of paragraphs without clarifying their role. This is a common pitfall in student writing known as perfunctory citation, creating the illusion of scholarship without contributing meaningfully to your argument (Tahamtan & Bornmann, 2019).

The following guide helps you classify and reflect on your citations.

## 📚 1. Citation Functions (Harwood, 2009)

Understanding the function of each citation helps ensure it serves a clear purpose in your writing.

| Function    | Description                                          | Example                                                              |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Signposting | Directs readers to background or further reading.    | "For background, see Smith (2005)."                                  |
| Supporting  | Provides evidence or confirmation for your claim.    | "Our findings align with those of Jones (2007)."                     |
| Credit      | Acknowledges ideas, methods, or data from others.    | "We used the framework developed by Chen et al. (2010)."             |
| Position    | States agreement or disagreement with cited work.    | "We challenge the conclusions of Lee (2012)."                        |
| Engaging    | Discusses or critiques prior work.                   | "Although X was proposed (Lee, 2012), we consider Y more effective." |
| Building    | Extends previous work.                               | "We extend the model of Green (2008)."                               |
| Tying       | Links related works or ideas.                        | "Both Smith (2005) and Taylor (2006) address this challenge."        |
| Advertising | Refers to your own prior work.                       | "In our previous study (Author, 2017), we explored..."               |
| Future      | Refers to planned or forthcoming work.               | "A full account will be published elsewhere (forthcoming)."          |
| Competence  | Shows familiarity with the field.                    | "As shown by Adams (2004) and Clark (2009)."                         |
| Topical     | Cites work related but not central to the argument. | "See also the study on cloud architectures (Nguyen, 2011)."          |

## ⚖️ 2. Citation Polarity (Li et al., 2013; Hernández-Alvarez et al., 2017)

The polarity of a citation indicates your stance towards the cited work.

| Polarity | Meaning                                  | Example                                            |
| :------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| Positive | Expresses support or agreement.          | "Our results confirm those of Jones (2007)."       |
| Neutral  | Provides factual or background information. | "As discussed by Smith (2005)."                    |
| Negative | Critiques or disagrees with cited work.  | "We find Brown’s conclusions (2009) unconvincing." |

## ✨ 3. Citation Influence (Hernández-Alvarez et al., 2017)

The influence level highlights the importance of the cited work to your own argument.

| Influence            | Meaning                                     | Example                                                        |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Significant positive | Core to your argument.                      | "We build directly on the method of Chen et al. (2010)."       |
| Significant negative | Important contrast or critique.             | "We refute the approach of Lee (2012)."                        |
| Perfunctory (avoid!) | Mentioned without meaningful integration. | "See also Adams (2004)." (without clarifying why)            |

> **Reminder**: A citation must never be a decoration. Every citation must serve a purpose in your argument.

## 👍👎 Patterns and Anti-Patterns in Citation Use

Reflecting on how you use citations can improve the quality and integrity of your scholarship.

### ✅ Good Practices (Patterns)

- Clearly state why the work is cited.
- Integrate the citation naturally into the flow of your argument.
- Use citations to frame your contribution relative to prior work.
- Vary citation types (supporting, engaging, building).
- Provide critical reflection when citing conflicting work.

### ❌ Bad Practices (Anti-Patterns)

- Adding citations at the end of paragraphs without explanation (perfunctory citation).
- Citing irrelevant or only distantly related work to inflate the bibliography.
- Overusing self-citations for visibility (self-promotion).
- Avoiding critical engagement (only listing references as "background").
- Failing to attribute methods, tools, or data you reused.
- Including many citations in a single sentence without clarifying the role of each.
